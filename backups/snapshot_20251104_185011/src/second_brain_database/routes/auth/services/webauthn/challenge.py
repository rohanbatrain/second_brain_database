WebAuthn challenge management service.

This module handles the generation, storage, and validation of WebAuthn challenges
for both registration and authentication flows. Challenges are cryptographically
secure random values that prevent replay attacks.

WebAuthn challenge functionality commented out as WebAuthn is not yet implemented.
All WebAuthn code has been commented out to prevent import errors and maintain codebase cleanliness.
